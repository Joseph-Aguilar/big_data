APEC 8222 - Big Data Methods for Economics

Assignment 1

This text file was edited using PyCharm because this is what we will use on the next assignments.
The objective of this assignment is that we master the Git workflow so that we can work easily with it on future projects.
I hope that this course will give me an idea of how to work with this kind of data and make me understand what is the potential of it. 
Until now, I know I should learn it because evryone else is doing it or trying to use this, but I would like to know how this can be useful for my research area (Policy Analysis).
I hope that the work we do in this course over the next few months will be fun and useful for both me and the instructors.
